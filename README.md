# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Juan Linares Orihuela**

**Wordle** Wordle is a popular word puzzle game that challenges players to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess by indicating which letters are in the correct position (in green) and which letters are part of the secret word but in the wrong position (in yellow). Players use deductive reasoning and word knowledge to narrow down the possibilities and ultimately guess the correct word. Wordle is known for its simplicity, addictive gameplay, and the satisfaction of cracking the word code within the limited attempts, making it a favorite word game for puzzle enthusiasts.
